# JPMTest
Test code for JPMorgan programming test

Please note that this project contains files for Visual Studio 2015,
but they are not required to build the project. JPMTechTest.cpp is
self contained, and should build on any platform that has a relatively
modern version of Boost installed.

Note for Visual Studio:
The project files assume that Boost is installed in C:\boost_1_63_0.
You will have to adjust the additional include directories and
link directories if Boost is installed elsewhere.
